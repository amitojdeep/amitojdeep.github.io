I am a Masters student at University of Waterloo, Canada pursuing research in applications of deep learning to retinal images. I have received my Bachelors in Computer Science and Masters in Economics at BITS Pilani, an Institute of Eminence in India. When I am not engrossed in academic activities, I can be found exploring recent deep learning techniques, catching up with newest technology, reading financial news or doing photography.

I am committed to doing research projects which have the potential of making a positive impact on humanity. My area of interest in Artificial Intelligence in general and specifically Deep learning. I have worked on projects spanning across Biometrics, Information Retrieval, Image Recognition, Medical Imaging, Natural Language Systems and Financial Forecasting.

I am interested in working on deep learning models to solve challenging problems across various domains. I yearn to learn something new and share my knowledge of deep learning and finance.
