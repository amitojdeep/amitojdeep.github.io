I am a 4th-year undergraduate student pursuing dual majors in Computer Science and Economics at BITS Pilani, a premier engineering college of India. When I am not engrossed in academic activities, I can be found exploring recent deep learning techniques or doing photography.

I am committed to doing research projects which have the potential of making a positive impact to humanity. I have worked on projects spanning across Biometrics, Information Retrieval, Image Recognition, Medical Imaging, Natural Language Systems and Financial Forecasting.

I am interested in working on upcoming deep learning models to solve challenging problems as well as cross domain deep learning projects.
