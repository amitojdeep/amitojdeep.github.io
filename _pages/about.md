I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student, pursuing a five year dual degree programme of Bachelors in Computer Science and Masters in Economics at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani.

Since childhood, Nature has always been my deep source of fascination and inspiration. Thoughts and conjectures on the birth of universe and beginning of intelligence have always amazed me. I wondered about how babies who knew only to _cry_ go on to think and comprehend things like _relativity_. I have been since then passionate to _decipher_ nature's most ingenious creation _" the brain"_. 

> **_" Solve intelligence, use it to solve everything else "_** <br>
>  _-  Demis Hassabis, CEO, Deepmind_<br>

This quote by Demis Hassabis aptly describes my above-mentioned passion. In order to pursue this passion, I have aspired to study and build machines which emulate the working of the human brain.  This eventually led me to pursue Computer Science as my major.  From the day I listened to Demis's talk, I have been learning about how humans have approached to solve this mystery of nature. I ventured into deep learning a year ago and believe it to be the key to unlock the mind. I am extremely passionate learning about _CNN, RNN, and Reinforcement learning_. The generality of these techniques is what that impresses me the most.

I believe the deep learning techniques and exploration of human brain perfectly complement each other. In one direction are based on ideas derived from the brain and in other direction, these techniques help us to further our understanding of the brain.
These ideas have led me to venture into Computational neuroscience and Brain-Machine Interfaces. My interest lies in application of Deep learning techniques in the above fields. Every bit of achievement in Neuroscience research and practice, I firmly believe, will greatly change the way and the quality of our life.

Armed with these ideas and beliefs, I aspire to be a part of this great quest of mankind to _“understand” intelligence_ and assiduously use it to serve humanity.
