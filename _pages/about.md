I am a 4th-year undergraduate student, pursuing dual majors in Computer Science and Economics at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, a premier engineering college of India. When I am not engrossed in academeic activities I can be found exploring recent deep learning techniques or doing photography.

I am committed to doing research projects which have the potential of making a positive impact to humanity. I have worked on projects spanning across Medical Imaging, Information Retrieval, Image Recognition & Processing, Natural Language Systems and Financial Forecasting.
