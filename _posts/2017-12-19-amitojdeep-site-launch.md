Hello World! After scrabbling my way around with Git Pages and Jekyll I have started putting up this site. I will be posting the deep learning articles that intrigue me as well as my own experiments over here.
Kudos to excellent post by <a href = "http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/" >Jonathan McGlone</a> which helped me to put this up faster than I thought.
